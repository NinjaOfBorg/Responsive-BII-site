# Responsive-BII-site

This is a collaborative effort to create a slick, responsive internal site to showcase what we do.
All D3 charts must be responsive and cross filter (dc.js)

So far, I have simply slapped a couple of responsive things together (a slider onto a rd template) and added a BG image.
